## In this project, a technology stack including React, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript, and Axios was used to create and manage the application state. The main task was to develop a user table with filtering and pagination features.

React: Used to create a component-based interface, including the user table, filter form, and pagination elements. Components are divided into logical blocks, ensuring their reusability and maintainability.
Redux Toolkit: Applied for centralized state management, simplifying the organization and handling of user-related state. A slice was created for users, containing the state, asynchronous actions for loading data, and user list filtering.
TypeScript: Used to ensure static typing, preventing errors during development and making the code more reliable and understandable. Interfaces were defined for users and state, allowing for strict control over the data structure.
Axios: Used to perform HTTP requests to an external API to fetch user data. In this case, the data is retrieved using the JSONPlaceholder service, which provides a fake API for testing.
Web Vitals: Performance metrics were integrated into the project using the web-vitals library, allowing the tracking of key web application performance indicators and optimizing its performance.
JSONPlaceholder was used as the data source for users, making it easy to integrate real data during the development and testing phases of the application.
